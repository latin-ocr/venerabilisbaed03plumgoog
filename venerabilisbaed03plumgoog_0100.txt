lxxxiv Introduction. [rur 11.

Prunofche 1 11. Before proceeding to describe the MSS. 11Β111,
mc it will bewellto give some account 11 the plan 11 this
edition. The text isbosed on 1 complete 1111111111 11 the
four oldest known MSS: viz. M, B, G, N. 01 these M
11111 so fur been taken ss the basis, that all deviatione
from ite text ure noted, except in the cnse 11 mere varia·
tiens 11 orthography, and even 11 these the more impor-
tentare registered. References to the telios 11 M ere
placed in the margin. 01 the other three MSS such
readings ere cited in the notes as seemed 11 importunae,

either intrinsically, or as illustrating the relationship
between the MSS. Iheve tried in 111 cases, where 1 MS.
hae been altered, to distinguish the original from 11111·
hands by 1 number placed obooo the symbol which
indicates the MS. in question. Thus N', N²‚ indicate the

first and second hands respectively in the Nemnr MS.
(Α number pleced below a symbol indicates that the MS.

tion. Thus the Harleian MSS. referred to are cited es
H, H„ &c.; the Oxford MSS. as O„ 0„ 111.) In regurd
to proper names I have, except in one or two cases 11

obvious blunders which are specielly noted, always
retained in the text the spelling 11 Μ, and hove given
in the notes the variatione 11 all the other three MSS.

Thus text and notes together will give a complete view

four MSS. 11 the eighth century ¹. In regerd 11 the
