which have come under my notice according to this
principle of clnssificntion.

MSS. of the Mdypc.

uss, or M, B, N heve been already described.
‘'mmm‘' Harl. 4978 (Η,). This is e 4to MS„ 24·oox17·75,
bllldilr ff. 151, written in c French hand of the tenth century.

The H. E. occupies ff. 8-148b. of the matter which
occupies the remaining leaves of tho MS. 1 will spsek
presently. The gotherings ore usually ol eight, but also of
sixend four. After f. ⁶7 a fold probablyol eight leaves hos
been lost and the lacuna hes been supplied by the inser-
tion of o feld often leaves of which the lest hns been
canoelled. The writing of this insertion is from 150 to
200 years later than the rest ol the MS. In some ceses,
cp. ff. 58, 59, 110, the writingis large and unnsturslly
spaced3 in others, c. 9. ff. 85, 92, it is unnoturully con·
tructed. This looks ns if the folds hod not been written

consecutively‚ but the luter sometimes before tho earlier ;
so thet the scribe hed to cover a definite amount of ¹
vellum to make them jein. This MS. humectionably
a direct trorescript from Μ. This is proved by many con·
vergsnt lines of evidence. (1) It abbreviatos the scrip-
tural quotations of Beds ss M does, and in precisely the
sume wcy¹3 end of nll the Mss. which I heve examined ,
11 is the only one besides M which does so abbreviato. ¹
(2) It agrees with n in msny of the latter’s most obvious
mistnkes3 cp. ‘pergens' for ‘pergebat' p. 113, note 1 ;
omission of ‘morsm‚’ p. 126, note 12 ; ‘nem' for ‘nec’
snd ‘corruit’ for ‘corruens' p. 130, notes 5, 8 3 omission
of ‘ueniens’ p. 149, note 4, of ‘merito’ p. 182, note 2;
the false reading ‘orientales’ for ‘occidentales’ pp. 194,
