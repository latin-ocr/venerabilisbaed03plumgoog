ac. (3) But the most decisivo evidence of copying is
given by those instances in which the scribe of H, hes
misinterpreted the reading of M. Thus, p. 253, Μ reads
‘ad 'calcariam ‘ciuitatem q:· (quae),' meaning that ‘calc’
and ‘cim’ are to be transposed H, perceives this, but
mistaking ‘q:·’ for the conjunctiora ‘que' transposes it
also, and reads ‘ciuitatemque calcariam,’ which makes
nousense. Agaiu, in v. 24, annal 538: ‘eclipsis solis .. .
ab hora prima usque ad tertiam,' Μ accidentally omits
‘solia' then adds it on the margin at the end of the line
with a mark of insertion after ‘eclipsis’ H, overlooks
this mark, and copying mechanieally reads: ‘eclipsis . . .
ab hora prima usquead tertiam solis².’ (4) Α further
proof of the connexion of the two MSS. is afforded by
the extracta which follow the H. E. These are identical
with those which occur at the end of M, as far as these
