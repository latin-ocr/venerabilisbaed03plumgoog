henoticum §p The life where the monastic rulo was strictly ob·
Nonnum- served must have been every hard one. 'lhe influence

of the Irish missionaries had impressed a strongly ascetic
character on the Northumbrian Ohurch. Beda tells of an
Irish monh, named Adamnan, inthe monastery of Oolding·
ham, who only touched food twice a week, on Sundays

and Thursdays ¹. Drythelmthemonkofhlelroso,whohad
the famous vision, would stand up to his loins, or some·

¹ times up to his neck, in the river Tweed‚ reciting prayors

and psalma, even breaking the ioe in winter to go in, and
letting his cold wat garments dry upon his body ², and
Outhbert is said to have done the same³. 'lbere can
indeed be little doubt that Outhbert’s mind was unhinged
by the austerities that he practised ⁴. Like some ol the
wild Covenanters, of whom Scott tells in Old Mortality‚
he fancied that he had visible conflicta with the powers of
darkness ⁵. A story in Bede’s life ol him brings out the
hardness of this monastic life in a pathetic manner.
