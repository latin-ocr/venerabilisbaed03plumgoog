of the fifteenth century, ff. 354· It contains theologica]
works, chiefly of Hugh of St. Victor end St. Augustino,
and is written in a very small and contracted hand,
very difficult to read. uf. 285a-301 a contsin six letters
of Rode, of which that 1ο Egbert is the last, occupying
ff. 296b-301a. This 1118. was consulted by Dr. Giles
for his edition of Bede's werke, and annotatione by
him will be found on the mergin; from it he pub·
lished for the first time the third letter oi the series ‘ad
Helmualdum de bissexto’ (see above, Part Ι, p. xxxvii),
the substance of which Beds afterwards incorporated in
the De Temporum Ratione (Opp. vi 222). The Merton
118. was the only one known to Smith (pressos), though
he did not follow its retdings in all respects. Stevenson
and Moberly simply reprinted Smith's text. The letter
1ο Egbert was first'published by Sir James Ware, Dublin
1664, 8vo, from whose edition it was reprinted by Whar·
ton: ‘Bedae. . . opera quaedam Theologica . . . necnon
Historics,’ dc.. ato Lond. 1693. Wharton confessos in his
prefece thathe had seen 1101180111. There can be no
doubt that Ware printed it from H. His text agrees
with H in all points in which H differs from M. It may
be sufficient to mention two instances3 it gives the
quotation attho end oi 1 7 in the abbreviated form oi
H, and it gives the date at the end (pp. 411, note 3; 423,
note 4).

There can be no doubt that the text of H is on the
whole very superior to that oi Μ, ss might be expected
from its much greater antiquity. But in some instances
M has preserved a better reading. By a comparison oi
the two MSS. Ihave been able 1 hope to give an im·
proved text; but it were much to be wished that some
additional MSS. might be discovered. 'For my know-
ledge of the existence of H sts indebted in the first
instance to the reference in H. & 8. iii. 326.
