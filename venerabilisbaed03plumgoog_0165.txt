720. Iu Gnrnsnr ¹.

In the course of the work Bede says: ‘Si enim hodi·
erna die, uerbi gratia, per oulendas Apriles esset luna
septima decima? Opp. vii. 117'. In his chronological
works Bede takes his exemplos from the aotual year in
which he iswriting‚ vi 130, 244, 249, 256. Ι1 is there
fore prohuble that he isdoing the same here; if so, this
criterion would fix it to the year 720, which would suit
very well. It must be before 731, as it is included in the
listof hisworlrs‚ Η. E. v. 24. It must be after 709 asit
is dedicated ‘antistiti Aecae! Opp. vii. 1. (‘Abbuti‚’
Opp. i. 169, is probablya mere misprint of Dr. (11122.
11 has misled Dr. Bright‚ p. 402.) The calculation of
the year from the criteria was made for me by my friend
hir. T. Α sir-cher, the historian of the Orusades

Before 725. Dr Rsrroun Brssaxnr.

This was incorporated in the De Temporum Ratione
(see above, p. xxxvii), and must therefore be anterior to it.
There is nothing to show by how muoh it preoeded it.
Beue, in incorporating it, merely says: ‘In epistola. . .
quondumdixi‘ Opp. vi. 222.

Before 725. Du Neruas Rnsurr.

This is earlier than 1122 De Temporum Ratione, 22 11 is
cited iu the prefaoe to that work, where it is coupled
with the De Temporibus: ‘duos quondam . . . libellos
composui) 0727221 139. But because the two worhs
are coupled together 11 would hardly be saie to assume
that they were oomposed 21 1122 seme time.

mention of that year no less than three times in
