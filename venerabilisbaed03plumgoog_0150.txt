be seen in Mr. Macray’s catalogue of the Digby MSS„ pp.
126, ¹²7· On f. 1 is the motto ‘uindica te tibi Kenolme
Digby.’ It isan evident transcript of Η,, as may be seen
from the fact that it has the same peculiarities of text,
cy. ‘militans’ for ‘militare' p. 365, note 3; ‘lenam’
for ‘aquilonem’ p. 368, note 3 ; ‘nomine ’ lor ‘regimine’
p. 372, note 1; and the right reading at the beginning of
§ 16, p. 380, note 14, &a Moreover it has the words,
p. 38¹, note 2, which all the other MSS. omit while in
§§ 20—21 it shows the same lacuna as H„ though the text
has been doctored a little. Δ has however peculiarities
of its own. These consist partly in accidental elipe and
omissions; partly in insertione of words such as ‘ igitur,’
‘ergo’ ‘autem,' ‘uero’ ‘enim,’ dcc, and other slight
changes intended to make the sentences run somewhat
more smoothly¹3 partly, as we have seen, in the correction
of obvious mistalres in H.. In only one instance of any
importance does Δ show a reading in agreement with the
other group ol MSS„ viz. the substitution of ‘donasse'
lor tho meaningless ‘ordinatum esse’ of Η, in ξ 7 ; and
ae the word ‘donauerat’ has imediately preceded, even
this may be an independent correction of the scribe ol Δ ;
while in the other οοεοο2 the agreement is ahnost certainly
fortuitous‚ the differeneee from Η, being merely due to
the scribe’s desire to improve his text.

He has however conflated his materiale in a curicus
