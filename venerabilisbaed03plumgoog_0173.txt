letter of Cuthbert on Bede's death (below, p. clxiv), and
such forms are not uncommon, and are due to the influ-
ence of the wealr AngloSaxon genitive ‘Bedam' In the
nominative it is ‘Baeda' (ib. p. clx). Nor must the
evident Irish affinities of the penitentia] be unduly
pressed, ior the Irish influence on the Northumbrien
Church was strong¹ (above, p. xxx). .

A etronger argument is that in the penitentinl ol'
Archbishop Egbert the author, while acknowledging his
obligations to Gregory and Theodoro, makes no mention
of Bede; which, seeing thet Bede wss his own master,
he could hardly fsil to do, had Bede written a penitential.

Another fact which points the same way is that Bede,
who says so much about the work of Theodoro, never
even alludes to hie penitential, which, considering its
importunes, would certainly be strange ii he were himself
interested in such literature ².

‘I'he penitential nsciibed to Bede is a mere collection of

exuacta from earlier works including Theodore's3 and

Wasserschleben himself, who accepts Bede’s authorship,
is constrained to aslr why Bede should hare made such

nmeagre compilation when Theodore's work was in

existence (a. e. p. 39).
On the whole the arguments are against Bede’s author

ship, and we should be thanlrful to believe that Bede had
had nothing to do with such a matter. The penitential
