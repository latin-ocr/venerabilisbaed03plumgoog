cxxxviii Introduction. [rear 11.

Life of St cuthbert ¹, Bsde’s metricsl end prose lives of
St. cuthbert, end the work on the seme seint by Reginsld
of Ooldinghcm or Durhsm⁹; lives of SS. Aidan, Ente',
snd Ebbs, end the Life ot St Godric by Geoffrey of
Durhcm ⁴. The MS. ‘is evidently the productiori of the
Durham Scriptorium⁶,’ and the name of the scribe is
given on fi 1: ‘nomen scriptoris est Petrus Plenus
Amoris ⁶.’ Between the lives of SS. Ebbc end Godric
come Bede’s nist. Abb. ff. 174 a-179s end the life of
Bede. The text oi the Hist. Abb. is identicsl with tbst
of D, endis, I believe, c transcript from it ⁷. ThisI
rsgsrd cs proved by the fact thet in§ 17 it snd P alone
keep the false reading of D : ‘iuxta euangelium regulam,’
which the other MSS. heve amended either by omitting
‘regulam' (O) or by eltering ‘euangelium’ into ‘euen-
gelii' (Β), thus restoring the reading of H„ The text cf
these six MSS. may be called the Dtext.

The Hist. Abb. vves first printed by Sir J emes ware,

Dublin, 1664, 8vo; reprinted by thrton, houden, 4to,
1693. 'l'he MS. used by Wsm wss 0. This is proved
by the fact that his edition reproduces the two salient
peculiarities of 0, the division into two books, end the
lacuna in ξ 18. It reproduces also most of the minor
peculiarities of C, slew obvious mistekes being corrected ⁸.
