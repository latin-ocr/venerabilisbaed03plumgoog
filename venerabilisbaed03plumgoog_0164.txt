71⁶. Iu Sauram ¹.

Between Books iii and iv occurs the passage given
above (pp. xv, rvi), with reference ιο Ceolfrr'd’s departure.
Therefore Books ι-ιιι were written before and Book iv ι
after June, 716. See the preceding entry.

716. Da Mruerouraus ιιιιοιιιιιι lenanu
716. Dn so ouon ur Isaras ‘Er cmunsuwa’ aru.

These two Epistles were written while Bede was l
engaged on the In Samuelem, i. c. in· 716, Opp. i. 198, l
202 3 apparently in the interval between Books ιιι and iv.
lb. ²03· They were written in answer to questions put
by Acca

After 716. Hrsroura Annaruu.

This muet be later than 716 as it narrates the death of
Ceolfrid and the electiou of Hwaetbert in that year.
From the fact that nothing is narrated after that date 3
it would not be safe ιο argue that ἰ must have been ι
written soon after 716, ae Bede might naturally feel
a delicacy in writing about the administration of Hwaet
bert, who, ae we saw (p. xiv), overlived him.

After 71⁶· Iu blancum

This was written after the In Samuelem, Opp. x. 37,
which, ae we have seen, was written in 716. The In
Lucam hed been written ‘ante annos plurimos.’ Ib. 3.
Probably, therefore, it is some time later than 716.

About 720. Vrra Saucrr Ounsaacrr.

This cannot he later than 721 as ιι is dedicated to Ead-
frid, Bishop of Lindisfarne, who died in that year. On
the other hand, ιι cannot be much earlier, as the De
Temporum Ratione, composed iu 725, speaks of it ae
written ‘nuper’ Opp. vi. 329·
