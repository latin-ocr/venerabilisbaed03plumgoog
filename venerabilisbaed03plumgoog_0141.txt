above ‘gramina’ while 0,, reversos them, puttiug ‘ gran·

0,, has over the word ‘undiqueuersum’ 1119 gloss ‘i ex
omni parte' 0,, writes in the text, ‘undique ex omniparte

p. 182, L 19, 0,, has 1119 reading ‘de obseruantia one

uantia ’ in the text with ίο119,’1. e. ‘obseruatione’ written

lated at the end, all after r. 20 being lost ; and from the (⁰1⁶)-
table of contente a good deal hasbeen lost besides the
conclusion of the Η. Ε. The clause ‘Praeterea omnes’
does not occur in the preface, we may therefore assume
that it was placed at the end; unless indeed, as with
Bu„ it occurred in neither place. But this is uulilrely.
After the word ‘studuimus’ with which the preface in
the coxi ende, this MS. has the unintelligible addition,
peculim to itself: ‘tempore pro Domino sanctum eet
fuderunt' The MS. came to the college ‘ex legato . . .
Roberti Retriuham‚ quondam Rectoris ecclesie Sancti
Gregorii Lundon. Oratis igitur pro eodem, et bene-
factoribus eiuedem, omnium ac fidelium animabus a
purgatorio liberandis’ There are no other marks of
ownership.
