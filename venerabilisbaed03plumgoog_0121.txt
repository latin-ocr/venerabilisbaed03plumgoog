100] The Monuccciptc. ov

The fact that the inserted matter has mainly to do
with wilfrid shows that the origin 01 thie MS. must be
northern 'l'he key to the position lice in an entry under
the year ⁶⁶7: ff abb. scri. (⁴ noster abbas scripsit ’).
Who was the northern abbot about 667 whose writinge
were so important as to deservo a special entry? The
anawer to that question would fix the locality of the
parent MS. 01 theec two groups The evident interest in
Wilfn'd suggests Hastam, Ripon, Yodr, or possibly
Lindiafarne? (lan it refer 10 the writing 01 the great
Lindisiarne Gospels by Eadfrid1? 11 00, the date is
probably placed too early.

01 the two groups, the D group is much nearer to 0
than the W group. This is not surprising, seeing that
I have already given reasons lor believing that 0 itseli is
a Lindisfarne or Durham bocla This greater nearncss
of D to G is shown hythe fairly numerous instances in
which they agree together against W. The⁸lollowing
may serve aa specimens: ‘itaque' G, D, p. 42, note 4, ‘iam-
que‚' W; ‘conuersione,’ C, D, p. 10⁶, note 3, ‘conuersa-
tione' W; ‘cognoscuntur,'0, D, p. 84, note 3, ‘noscuntur,’
W; ‘uocatun’ O, D, p. 253, note 9, ‘appellatus’ W;
ι0000111130, D, p. 286, note 7, ‘uocabatur,' W; ‘institu-
tionis’ Ο, D, p. 332, note 3, ‘institutis' W.

For thia reason I take the Durham group first in order.
