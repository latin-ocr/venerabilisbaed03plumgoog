two most decisivo cases aro the following. In iii. 25,

in brackets. 01¹ has inserted on the margin ‘usque

this defective reading is the reading of the text 010„ ‘

Ο,Ι has on the margin expanded cons. (rightly) into ‘con ’
sulatus‚' adding ‘sui’; but 0,, Η,, Ar. have au the im·
possible expansione of the contractione ‘ ante et constantio

the additional matter in Ο, was largely identioal with
thatin Η, and Ar. I have little doubt therefore that

0,, H„ and Ar. were all copied from a common original,
