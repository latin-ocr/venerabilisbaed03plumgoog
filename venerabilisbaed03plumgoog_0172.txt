clvi Introduction: Appeodic I.

These are all the werke of Bede for the genuineness of

I mention only those few with reference to which 1 hare
something to say.

that in some of them the name of the author is given in
the genitive ae ‘Beduni’ or ‘Pethani' might incline us
to ascribe it rather to some lrish continental monk
named Baedan or Baeithin. 'Phe argument from the
torm ot the name cannot, however, be pressed, as the
genitive ‘Bedani²' occurs in the S. Gallen copy oi the
