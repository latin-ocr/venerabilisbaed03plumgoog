‘After thio, still in AEdelelm’s hund. are twelve hexa-¹
metere beginning “Summe (ior Sume) peter placidus
modulantis nota poete.'' They form the preiace te c
poem addreeeed to Egbert, Biehop of Lindiolerne (803-
821) by AEthelwulf. . . ‚The verses end at the. bottom
oi the pege, and no doubt the whole poem followed on
leaves now missing. There is however reason to believe
that they are in the Britinh Mueeuan in MS. Cott. Tib. D.
iv. u 309-318. These leaves, which have nothing to do
with the rest of the MS. (Livee of Seints of the twelith
cent) with which they ere bound up, contain the poem
oi AEtholwuli, without the prefatory lines, end beginning
at the top of the pege. Allowing for the injury done to
them hythe fire oi 1731, they are oi the same dimensione¹
as the Wincheoter MS, end the hund . . . appears to be
identical with thet oi the lines in the latter volume.’
