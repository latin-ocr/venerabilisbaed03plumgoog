At the British Museum my special thanlrs are due

rescarches‚ but for sending me written information
on various points whenI was prevented by illuess

and ιο their learned Librarian‚ Dr W. Greenwell‚ my
best thanks are duc. 1 am also indehted ιο my
brother, Dr. A.P1ummer‚ for verifying for me some
points which Ihad overlooked. A like service was

F. Τ. Madge. My original examination of the Win-
chester MS. was made under the hospitable roof of
my dear friend, Dr. Kitehin, now transferred ιο ο

Το the Delegates of the Clarendon Press Ι am in-
dabted for entrusting me with the execution of this

words of St. Ignatius‚ and say: εὔχομαι μὴ εἰς μαρτύριον
