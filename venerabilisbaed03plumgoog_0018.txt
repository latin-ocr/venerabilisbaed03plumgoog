himself. In the first cese they deservo oerelul oon-

In the notes I heve brought together whet I eould
from other sources to illustrate the historioel, soeiel,
end eeclesiastioel bearings of Bede's text. Most ol
these sources ere, of course, obvious enough. My
speeisl studies heve enabled me to edd some less
obvious illustretions from Celtio end Seundinevien
sourees. One importent souroe of illustretion hus
been almost wholly neglected by previous editors.
Ι meon the other writings of Bede himself. Yet
spurt from the numerous direct illustrations of the
text whioh they supply, the whole texture of Bede's
thought, the whole tone end temper of his mind, is
so consistent, thet we ean hardly judge even his his-
torionl works eright, without some knowledge of his
other writings, espeoislly of his theologieul works.
To attempt to judge of Bede merely us en historiun
is inevitebly to misjudge him. In history end in
soienee, se well es in theology‚ he is before ull things
the Christian thinker end student.
