²¹¹⁰ ⁰⁴5¹* We come now to two groups oi Mss, which are closely

11181111 related to (l, and also to one another. We may call these ’

(ἶζζῖξξζ, the Durham and the winchester group respectively ; 81 the

MSS· head of the former group stands the MS. belonging 1ο the
Dean and Chapter of Durham, B. 11. 35 (1)), 81 the head oi
the latter the MS. belonging to the Dean and Chapter of
winchester, No. 3 (111). The chief point in which these
two groups agree with one another, and differ from 0, is
the insertion of considerable additions in Bede's chrono-
logical summary. (See the critical notes to v. 24.)
Further, both groups differ greatly from C, and imm 811
normal MSS. of whatever type in the divisione between
the chapters; the divisione being very unskiliully made,
sometimes even in the middle of 8 sentence. But in
this matter of the divisione of chayters, the two groups
not only differ strongly from (l, but also from one
another. Hence we must conclude that the original
MS. from which these two groupa are ultimately derived
(1) was closely related 1ο 0; (11) contained additional
matter in the chronological epitome; (111) had the
divisione between the chapters marked very imperfactly
ornet 81 811, 88 that later scribes, guided by the capitula,

had 1ο make the divisione as best they could.
