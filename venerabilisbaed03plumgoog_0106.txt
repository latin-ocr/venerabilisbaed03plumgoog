xc Introduction. [Pur 11.

extract from St. Isidore on prohibited degraes, ond the
decree of Gregory II in the Roman Council of 7²¹· The

latter is mutilated owing to a folio having been excised
at the end. The MS. hasbeen corrected throughout by
later hands, some of which at any rste are at least two
centuries later ¹. ι

Apnrt from the fact that the existence of other MSS.

of equal weight precludes the iden of basing the text
solely on M, this MS. isnot so uniformly correct as to be
above criticism. The notes give frequent testimony to
this fact². The spelling is peculiar and arbitrer-y,
especially in the matter of double letters ; thus we have
‘accesit’ ‘cesisse‚' p. ²03 ‘misus’ p. 89; ‘insit' p. 45 ;
‘decolatus’ p. 21, note 1 ; ‘positis ’ (fer ‘possitis ’), p. 44,
note 2 ; ‘anuo’ p. 111 3 ‘dificultas’ p. 14. On the other
hond: ‘persuassio,' p. 53; ‘suessio’ p. 112; ‘dis-
possuisse‚'p. 130; ‘misserant,’p. 137, note3 ; ‘tollerare'
p. 83 ; ‘Cessare' for ‘Caesare' p. 122. Words ending in
-c'r', its, &c., are generally written with a single t, but not
nlways; we get even such forms as ‘pissimo' for ‘piis
simo‚' p 44, note 5 ; i and care in hopeless confusion, so
thot the testimony of this MS. is practically worthless ns
to whether we should read, oy. ‘suscipimus' or ‘sus-
cepimus’ p. 14ο; ‘occidere’ or ‘accedere’ pp. 59, oo.
This is the ease in some degree with the other three
MSS„ but not to the same extent. A further pcevrlinrity
of this MS. is the way in which the scribe abbreviates
the scripture quotations in the text, giving the first few
words, and the last few words with the phrase ‘usque ad’
between them, pp. 102, 111, 188, tto, or else adding
‘et cet'after the first words, pp. 58, note 1 ; 124, note 2.
