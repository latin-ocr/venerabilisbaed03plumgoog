MSS.. end had not realised fully the worthlessness (100
textual purposes) 01 this MS. We need not go beyond
the preface and the first chapter 01 the first book to see
how ignorant the scribes 'were 01 ¹hatin3 thus: ‘pree

scriptum‘ for ‘presbyterum' p. 6, 1. 15; ‘scripture
padsumsi’ for ‘scripta repperi, adsumsi‚' p. 7, 1. 2 from
bottom; ‘unum ferunt’ 100 ‘auium ferun’ p. ro, l. 2;
‘pallerare’ for ‘ pallescere‚' ib. 14, &c Their ignorance
01 history and geographyis shown by the way in which
they have bungled over the word ‘Scotti·'; thus: ‘ad-
mntos’ 100 ‘ad Scottos‚’ heading of i. 133 ‘rectorum’
and ‘sanctorum’ for ‘Scottorum’ p. 71, 11 8, 22, &c

‘quia' and ‘quod' are constantly confused3 so ‘pen’
‘praa' ‘pro,’ ‘post' and ‘pmpter'3 ‘con’ ‘cum,' and
‘contra'3 ‘tamen’ and ‘tantum'3 ‘sed’ and ‘siout’;
‘a'and ‘aut'; ‘hoc' and ‘autem’3 ‘aut’ and ‘ante’;
‘effi’ (episcopo) and ‘ipo ’ (ipso) p. 328, l. 16. Omissions
are frequent; the most important being in v. 12, and at
the end of v. 22. Sometimes the scribes could not read
their copy, and spaces were 1011 which were only filled
up luter, or not at all. 'I'he MS. has been corrected
throughout by later hands. But the corrections are osten
as bad as, sometimes worse than, the original text¹.
Hence, except in the case of proper names' this MS. is
only sparingly cited. Nor need 11 be taken into account
in discussing the mutual relationships 01 11ιο various
