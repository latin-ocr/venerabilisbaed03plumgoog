finiahed the H. E. in 731 ¹. At that point tho chrone
logical summury in tho lli-text stopa The insertion in
the O-text oi two later annale, 733 and 734, seems to
show that that recension was made in the latter ycer;
and ae the death of Archbiehop Tetwin ie not mentioned
in that pert of the 734 unnel which ie embodied in the
cerr, it ie probeble that that recension wee mede before
July 30, 734, the date of Tetwin’e death. Moreover the
facts that he wae the ninth arohbiehop‚ and thet his
accession coincided with the fifteenth year of Ethelbeld
of Mercia would eeem more important in the year of his
accession than three yeera letor

fourth book ended with ιι. 3ι, which' ιιι feet formsme
a much more natural conclusion to it then the succeed-

iv. 3ο where the ordinary text reads: ‘quaedam‚ quae
noe nuper audieee contigit, superadicere commodum
duximuu’ several lllSS. read‘ unum quod’ for‘ quaedam,
quae’; showing that originally only one miracle, that ιιι
iv. 31, followed, and that the miracle ιιι iv. 3² ie a latei
addition Curiouely enough it rs in MSS. which are
wholly or mainly oi the latest or c-reeension that this
trace ot the carlieet receneion hae been preserved. With
thia fact ie no doubt connected the variety in order end
reading which the MSS. of ull three classes exhibit in
the capitula ofiv.31‚ 3²·
