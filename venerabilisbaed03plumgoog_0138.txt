The name ol another possessores it seems to ooeur:
‘Sam Coluile, Scotue.' This charles Fairfax was
a son of the first Lord Fairfax‚ brother of the second,
and uncle of the third, the famous parliamentary
general. He was a barrister by profession, but in the
civil war he beoame a colonel of f00t3 like his more
famous nephew he joined with Monk in the restoration
of Gharlea 11. He died in 1⁶73 (Fairiax Correspon-
donee, 1. lviii, i). Some elegiae verses addressed to
him are on the flyleaf oi the MS. It was by the be
quest of his nephew, the great Lord Fairfna that this

and other MSS. came to the Bodleian. It contains κ

besides the Η. R, Outhbert’e letteren the death oi Rode,
and Abho of Fleury’s Pession of st. Edmund (imperfect)
prefaced by Abho's well-known letter to Dunstan. Two
marginal notes on iii 27 and iii. 28 show the interest ol
the Selby scribein the ecelesiastica history of neighbour-
ing districts: ‘nota quod Lindissi insula proprium
hahuerit episcopum ;' ‘note quod Hripensis eeclesia pro·
prium habuerit episcopum! The word ‘papa' hae Men
occasionally erased. It is e poor and uninteresting MS.

¹·- oentury. Α poor and carelesaly written Ms. It oonteins,

besides theH. E„ the letter on the death ol Bede, and Bede’s
Commentary on the Catholio Epietles, the last being in
a different hand. It is mutilated at the beginning.

of these three MSS„ O²⁰ and 0⁶ are C·texts with the
insertion of iv. 14. O¹⁴ has further the insertion oi
‘cuius supra meminimus’ in iv. 18. But in all three
the H. E. in the first hand ends abruptly with the words:
‘Martyrologium de nataliciie‚’ v. 24, p. 259, l. 15. This
isnot due to mutilation, asin all three MSS. Cuthbert's
letter follows immediately, and the agreement cannot be
accidental All three MSS. must therefore he ultimately
derived from some MS. in whioh a leaf had been lost
