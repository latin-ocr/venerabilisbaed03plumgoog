4111 the chronological summary, v. 24, tho C·text
ends the annal 731 with the word ‘archiepiscopus’
omitting the words ‘nonus. . . inperii’ (p. 356). It then
emhodies the annals 733, 734 (which in the lli-text occur
in a sort of appendix after the close of the world, after
which it proceeds with Bede’s notice of his life and
works.

5.1n the list of Bede’s works the 011111 omits 1111
excerpts from Jerome on the Propheta: ‘In Isaiam . ..
excerptas,' p. 358.

the symbol 0, 11 means that the original 01111 has been

'l'he same phenomenon occurs in the pure 11111 MSS.
'ihus in W and 0ι tho words ‘cuius supra meminimus'
(No. 3) have been inserted. In01thewords ‘nonus .. .
inperii' (No. 4) are inserted. Again in 0,, though iv. 14
is not actually inserted in the text there is a mark made
that something is wanting. These instances are interest
ing os enabling us to trace the actual steps by which the
process of conflation took place. The most striking case
cithia occurs also in 0,. This has the clause ‘Praeterea
omnes. . . inueniam' at the end of the work (No. 1,
thpe). Α later scribe has inserted the clause at the
end oi the prelace in accordance with the lli-type. But
he did not delete the passage at 1111 end of 1111 work;
