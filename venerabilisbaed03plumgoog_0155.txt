μα] The Menoeceos. cxxxix

Moreover that these correctione were made by Ware out
of hie own head without reoouree to other MSS. ie shown
by the fact that in two instanoes his corrections do not
agree with any MS.¹

Smith (1722) collated Ware’e text with D, P, and aMS.
whioh he ealle ‘Mertom’ but which was probably, ae
Huesey (Praei. p. v) suggests, Fairlaa, no MS. of the
Hist. Abb. existing in the Merton Library. Henoe
Smith‘s edition exhibite all the features of the D-text.

Steveneon (1841) was the first editor to base his text
on H„ and it ie consequently a great improvement on
that of hie predecessore.

Huseey(1846) practically reprinted Smith's text, though
he need Stevenson’e edition, and aleo Digby 112 for the
notes. His text is a retrograde step as compared with
that oi Stevenaon.

Moberly (1869 and 1881) reprinted Smith's text, eol·
lating it with Fairfax‚ from which he wrongly aeserta
that Smith's text is taken.

Whether the differendo between the Htext and thermino
Dtext impliee a double recension by Bede himself, like fflssiom
that which 1 believe to have existed in the ease oi the
Η. Ε., ia hard to say. 011 the whole 1 do not think the
differeneee are greater than might be accounted for by
aeribel variatione. If this ie eorreot, the relations of the
existing MSS. might be exhibited eomewhat as follows:
