has been already said of Bede’s interest in the Paschal

qffiossiffiwffiae of the Ohurch vary fromage ιο age, and
many of the controversias in which Bede engaged with
such ardour seem pale and colourless ιο us We hare

lost· also much of our zesl ior orthodoxy as such. We «

think that questions of practice are more important than
questions oi doctrine. It remains, however, ιο ιο seen
whether we can, in the long run, maintain the super
structure of Christian practice, when we have undermined
the basis of Christian doctrine on which it has been
reared

But whatever the difficulties of our times may be, Bede
has a source of consolation for us. He remarks truly
that the different forms of error often mutually destroy
one another¹ ; and in a fine passage he shows how much
the Ohurch has indirectly owed to the multitarious here·
sies hy which she has been attached But for this, the
greated works of Athanasius and ambioso, Hilnry and
Augustine would have remained unwritten ¹. Itis the
law oi antagonism‚ of the struggle for existence, oi the
surrival of the flttest applied to religione things; the old
Heraclitean doctrine that oppositionis salutary, that the
iahsst harmony results from difformes, and that all
things are evolved by way ol striis& And we may be
sure that the outcome of our present difficulties, if we
only meet them faithfully and bravely, will but be to en·
large our view of and confirm our hold upon the truth.
