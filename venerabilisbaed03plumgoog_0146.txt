cxxx Introduction. [1161 11.

4 and 5 cannot bs applied: in other respecta it seems
to be taken 116111 6 MS. 61 the Mtype. About the sams
time Eggssteyn printed an edition 61 the Latin version 61
Eusebius. Both these were reprinted at strasburg in
a single volume in ¹500· The Bede reproduces 6111116
features 61 the editio princeps; and this is the ease also
with the reprint of the same two works by Heinrich
Gran, Hagenau, 1506. ln 1550 6 separate edition 61
Bede'sH.E. was published at Antwerp by John Grauius¹.
This not only contains the whole 61 v. 14, but the
continuation 61 Bede's Chronologyis given continuously

with it, preceding the list oi Bede’s works The prelace ³

ends with ‘studuimus ².’ 'Phe work ends: ‘Te deprecor
. . . faciem tuam, qui uiuis st regnas etc. Amen³.’
'Phen comes Bede's epitaph, and the date of his decth3
and then ‘Beda ad lectorem. Omnes.. . inueniam.
Vale ⁴.' But I am inclined to think that this arrange
ment is due to the editor. In most 61 1116 1661 points
this edition follows the M-text. These features are
reproduoed in the collected Baelo edition 61 Bede’s 1661116
1563, except that the clause ‘Beda ad lectorem . . . Vale'
isprintsd (in a different type) at the end of the prefaoe.
All these editions 616 111 folio. Octavo editions 611116
Η.Ε. appeared at Louvain in 1566, and in 1566-7.
In 1583 it was embodied in the Hist. Christ ueterum
patrum by 116116 (16 16 Β6116, Ρ6116; and in 1587 in
commelin’s Rerum Britannicarum Scriptores, Heidel-
berg. This last seems to have been taken from a good
MS. 61 1116 lli-type‘. The continuation is printed 6611·
tinuously‚ but distinguished by different type. In 1601
111616 was an 8vo edition 611116 H. E. at Cologne, and in
1612 appeared the cologne reprint 61 the Basle edition 61
