cii Introduction. [sm ιι.

from Egbert to Henry ΙΙΙ, and occupies ff. 1 a-4 b, come
the capitula of all the five books of the H. Ε. con·
secutively‚ ff. 4o-7b; whereas in all other MSS. that
Ihave examined the capitula of each book immediately
precede that book. Further, at the end the beautiful
invocation ‘teque deprecor, bone Iesu. . . ante faciem
tuam,' is omitted. This is not due to mutilation; ior
the H. E. ends on f. rore, andtheremainder offf. 101,102
is occupied with other matter. In one or two points it
shows an affinity with ll. Thus it emite the clause:
‘gratulabatur ille. ..gauisus eet’ at the end of v. 22 ;
it agrees with N in the peculiar reading in v. 12, ‘postea
autem,’ &c Scep. 309, note 2. But as ithae not the
lacuna which in N immediately precedes that passage,
it cannot be a transcript of N; and the same is true of
other peculiarities of N which are not sharod by R. But
spart from these points the text of the H. E. ie die
located in the most extraordinery way; and as the points
of dislocation occur, not merely in the middle of a column,

but ae a rule in the middle of a line, the dislocation must η

be due to the scribe having copied mechenioallya MS.
in which the getheringe had been misbound‚ and one
gathering lost altogether. The text now occurs in the
following order. After the capitula (o. a.) we have:

(ι) Profaee to i 27, ending with ‘quia pro ueritate’
p. 51, l. 15, ff. 7b to roc = 13} ff. of the MS. or 47 peges
of the present edition.

(2) iii. 9, beginning ‘Christianorum prorsus oboleri'
(sic), p. 145, l. 5, to iv. 2, ending ‘erant instruoti’ p. 2ο4,

(3) ii. 1, beginning ‘aduenientibus nuper,' p. 79, l. 4
