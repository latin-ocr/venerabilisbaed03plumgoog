Γ1110 dates of these two works ure mutuully (1000011001,
and therefore they must be considered together. The letter
is addreesed 10 Plegwin, umonk of Hexham ¹, in enswer to
un abeurd charge of heresy whichhndbeen brought'against
Bede ‘a lasciuientibus rusticis. . . per pocula’ 10 000-
0011100 with the De Temporibus. Opp. i. 144. ’11110110
sayn, was written ‘ante quinquennium.² Ib. 145. And
110 begs that his defence may be read ‘coram uenerabili
Domino. . . Wilfrido antistite’ The latter must there-
fore fall within the period 705 κ 709, during which wil-
frid recovered the See of Hexhom ². (H. ll. v. 19 and
notes.) At the end of the De Temporibus Bede says:
‘Tiberius dehinc quintum egit annum? Opp. vi. 138.
Tiberius III (Apsimarus) seized the throne 10 698; his
fifth year therefore is 701-3. Α11110 beginning of the
chapter Bede says: ‘Sexte uetes 00011001 annos prae-
teritos 0001111 '3 thie 10 e mistuke for 000111, the v being
wrongly inserted. Both these dates, 1111110 fifth year of
’1111011110 and the dete 70311. 0., occur in 0. 14 01 the work,
Opp. 11. 130, a passage which seems to have been over·
looked. This, 11101110 the dete 01 the De Temporibus,
and the Letter 10 Plegwin is fixed to 708.

Before 705. Vrrn Marmor Cunnaucrr.

This must be earlier than 705 as 11 speaks 01 Aldfrid of
Nerthumbria as still alive: ‘nostrum regit inclitus
orbem‚’ 0. 11 ud 7111, Opp. Min. p. 25. The De 'Pem-
porum Ratione composed 10 715, speaks of it ss written
‘ante aliquot annos’ Opp. vi. 3²9· In H. E. iv. 16 [18],
10001001, 17100 per alphabetum ² We see here fresh evidence
